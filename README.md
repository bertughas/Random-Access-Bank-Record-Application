# Random Access Bank Record Application

This is a simple bank record application implemented in C, allowing random access to customer data. The program enables various operations such as adding customers, listing customers, deleting customers, updating customer information, and creating a customer list. It leverages file I/O for persistent storage of customer data.

## Features

- **Add Customer**: Add a new customer to the system with a unique ID, name, surname, and initial balance.
- **List Customers**: Display a list of all existing customers along with their information (ID, name, surname, balance).
- **Delete Customer**: Delete a customer from the system based on their ID.
- **Update Customer**: Update the information or balance of an existing customer.
- **Backup Program**: Create a backup of the customer data file.
- **Create List (Reset)**: Clear the existing customer data and create space for a new list of customers.

## Usage

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.
